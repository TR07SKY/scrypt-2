This epic soviet hash algorithm (maded to be used in crypto PoW) \
uses a communist only-CPU combination of scrypt, yespower and m7  \
that destroys any posibility of capitalist GPU/FPGA or ASIC. 

1st : do power2b over the input \
2st : do scrypt^2 over the output of power2b \
3st : do high precision floating point math over the two results \
4st : return uint256 (ready to be used in a coin)

This super epic soviet hash uses 128MB of RAM per mining thread!!!! \
the scrypt^2 do the high RAM usage, power2b uses L2 cache to prevent \
GPUs SM usage (too slow). m7 math fuck FPGAs / ASICs with the use of \
IEEE754
